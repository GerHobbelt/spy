# SPY - C++17 preprocessor-less informations gathering

## Purpose
Detection and versioning of operating systems, compilers, architecture and other element are
traditionally done using preprocessor macros. Library like Boost.Predef [link] provides a sanitized
interface on top of those but still live in a world where the preprocessor is king.

SPY is a C++17 (and onward) library that gathers similar informations and provides a constexpr
compatible interface to access those information, thus making their exploitation safe within the
now widely accepted if constexpr language construct.
